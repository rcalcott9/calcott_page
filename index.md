Hi! I'm Rachel

I'm a third year PhD student studying moral cognition at Harvard, advised by Fiery Cushman. 

I’m interested in how humans learn what's 'right' and 'wrong', and how these moral values are adjusted over time. I study how people learn from thought experiments (such as reflective equilibrium), how they learn from other humans, and how they learn from AI. To do this, I use behavioral and computational methods, and talk to strangers about their moral values on the subway. 

Some other things I like: playing the bass guitar. trying to make sushi. running along the charles. hosting tea parties. reading and writing science fiction.
